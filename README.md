## Planning

##### User Stories:
    
    As a User (Customer),
    I want an application/website,
    Where I can easily and enjoyably share my experiences and read other user's experiences, good and bad, about restaurants big/small.
    Because it will give insight to other users about the quality of food/service.

    As a User (Restaurant Owner),
    I want an application/website, 
    Where I can easily view my restaurant's reviews,
    Because it give me insight on how my restaurant is doing and that will allow me to make potential adjustments/improvements accordingly.
